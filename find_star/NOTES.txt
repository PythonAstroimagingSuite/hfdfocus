Notes for code to find focus stars
----------------------------------

Last updated 2019/05/24

Currently the code is based on a pull of the SAO Catalog from Vizier.

The pulled file 'SAO_Catalog.dat' has 4 columns:

SAO #, RA(J2000), DEC(J2000), Vmag, HD #, delFlag

If the delFlag is 'D' then ignore the record.

SAOCatalog Object
-----------------
The SAOCatalog object is used to hold the catalog once read with the
load_SAO_Catalog_binary() function.  The write/load functions just pickle
the SAOCatalog object to disk.  This is fairly fast.

The original catalog file can be read in to initialize an SAOCatalog object
using its read_catalog() method.  This is only necessary when creating the
binary version of the catalog the first time.

The read_catalog() function will filter out any catalog entries with delFlag
set to 'D' as well as entries without a Vmag.

When the catalog is created with saocatalog_create the max (brightest) and
min (faintest) magnitudes as well as the minimum (Southernmost) declination
can be specified to reduce the catalog size.

The SAOCatalog is supposed to be complete to around 9th magnitude which is
probably adequate for focus stars.

find_nearby_stars.py
--------------------
The program find_nearby_stars reads the catalog (binary form) and accepts
an RA/DEC (J2000) as well as a max/min magnitude range as well as a distance
in which the candidates should fall.

It searches the catalog for matching candidates, then for each candidate it
will look to see how many stars in the catalog are within 1 degree of it.  It
will reject any candidate with another star within 0.15 degrees.

Finally it sorts the candidates by the number of nearby stars and returns the
list.

saocatalog_exclude_stars.py
---------------------------
This program goes through the SAO Catalog and flags any stars with another
star within 0.15 degrees.  The list of catalog index numbers and SAO numbers
are written to the file 'sao_exclude_lst.txt'.
